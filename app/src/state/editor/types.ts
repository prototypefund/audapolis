 *   Audapolis keeps track of two cursors in a document: The player cursor and the user cursor.
 *   The user cursor denotes the element the user placed the cursor at. If can only live at item boundaries.
 *   userIndex == 0 means that the user placed the cursor in front of the first item in the document
 *   The player cursor is the time in seconds in the document the playback is at / last stopped at
 *   `current` selects which cursor dictates the user-perceived position of the cursor (i.e. what we show)
 *   `current` is determined by the following rules:
 *   - pressing play sets `current` to 'player' and updates `playerTime` to the start time of the item at `userIndex`, iff `current` was 'user'
 *   - clicking in the document or moving the cursor using the arrow keys sets `current` to 'user' and updates `userIndex` accordingly
